# WorkDaySchedulePlanner
US: 'AS AN employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively'

## Description 

This application was dealing with bootstrap, web APIs, jQuery, local storage and moment.js (or some other time function). We had to make a work-day scheduler that displays the time in a bootstrap jumbotron, along with a table with work day hours on the first column followed by an input column and then a column of save buttons to save the corresponding inputs into the local storage. 

This was a challenging assignment but interesting to learn new ways to loop, such as using split to split the IDs into different arrays and then loop through the [x] of the resulting arrays. 

One thing I am still struggling with though is the local storage.
